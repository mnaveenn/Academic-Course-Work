The biggest challenge while implementing this project is, coming across the character that is already not present in the encoded tree. We can overcome this challenge by, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Choosing a data set with wide range of characters involved.}
    \item{Whenever a new character is identified the encoded tree can be modified, this method may seem little redundant but in long run it will be efficient. We assume that for each new input at least one new character is identified. As the number of inputs are increased the character range of tree will also be increased. }
\end{itemize}
